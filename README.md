# Quickla 

Quickla is a productivity tool in the form of a collection of macros written in Multi-Edit's 
CMAC C-style macro programming language. Multi-Edit is a commercial text editor for Microsoft 
Windows. The main features of the suite are:

1. quick access to links, folders, files and applications,
2. list management and
3. miscellaneous utilities.

All the macros run from within Multi-Edit running on Windows 10 and older versions.
